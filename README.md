# FastAPI + Vue.js Single Page Application

Inspired from [Developing a Single Page App with Flask and Vue.js](https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-vue-crud),
this is a multi-language project using :
* FastAPI as a backend API in the `server/` folder,
* Vue.js as the frontend JS framework in the `client/` folder

(A goal for the project is to test how well PyCharm Ultimate responds to a Python/Vue.js project 
opened in the same window).
